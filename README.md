# UNIFY PROJECT - RFCs

"The UNIFY project aims at influencing standardization work globally, ensuring that European positions are well represented in the resulting recommendations and standards."

This is a collection of Requests for Comments for the UNIFY project.

## RFC Specification Process

The overall RFC process is defined by [UnifyProject/draft/RFC-1](https://github.com/hintjens/RFC-1/blob/master/draft/rfc-1.md).

The current editing process is:

* All specifications have a single responsible editor.
* All changes should be driven by GitHub issues that clearly identity a single problem, and optionally suggest one or more solutions.
